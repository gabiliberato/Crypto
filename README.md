### Classic Cyphers
* [Rot13](https://github.com/gabiliberato/Crypto/blob/main/rot13.py) 
Simple encryption method. It shifts each character of the clear text string 13 positions forward in the alphabet.

* [Cesar](https://github.com/gabiliberato/Crypto/blob/main/cesar.py) 
Method in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

* [Decoder Cesar Cypher](https://github.com/gabiliberato/Crypto/blob/main/brute-cesar.py)
Brute force attack (trying all possible shifts and determining which one works). 

* [Vigenère](https://github.com/gabiliberato/Crypto/blob/main/vigenere.py)
Vigenere cipher is a poly-alphabetic substitution system that use a key and a double-entry table.

* [Frequency Analysis](https://github.com/gabiliberato/Crypto/blob/main/freq-analysis.py)
Is the study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext.

* [Vernam](https://github.com/gabiliberato/Crypto/blob/main/vernam.py)
Is, in theory, a perfect cipher. Instead of a single key, each plaintext character is encrypted using its own key. This key — or key stream — is randomly generated or is taken from a one-time pad, e.g. a page of a book. The key must be equal in length to the plaintext message. To use the Vernam cipher, you will need to use an XOR operation.
